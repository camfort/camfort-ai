What is a unit-of-measure?<br>


### ChatGPT

A unit of measure is a standard quantity used to express a physical quantity. For example, the meter is a unit of length that is used to measure the distance between two points. Different types of quantities, such as length, mass, and time, have their own units of measure. These units are used to ensure that measurements are consistent and can be easily compared and understood.


### Human

What are examples of units-of-measure?<br>


### ChatGPT

There are many different units of measure, and the specific units used depend on the quantity being measured. Some common examples of units of measure include:

These are just a few examples of units of measure. There are many other units that are used to measure a wide range of physical quantities.


### Human

Units-of-measure can be combined using multiplication \(using \* or juxtaposition\), division \(using /\) or exponentiation \(using \*\*\). This forms compound units-of-measure. For example,<br>
<br>
miles / hour<br>
meter\*\*2 / second\*\*2<br>
kilogram meter / second<br>
foot \* pound<br>


### ChatGPT

Yes, that's correct. Compound units of measure can be created by combining individual units using multiplication, division, or exponentiation. These compound units are often used to express the relationship between different physical quantities. For example, the unit "meter per second" could be used to express the speed of an object, while "meter squared per second squared" could be used to express its acceleration.


### Human

Fortran variables can be assigned units-of-measure by adding a comment in the following format before the variable declaration:<br>
<br>
\! unit \<unit-of-measure\> :: \<variable-name\><br>
<br>
Here are some examples:<br>
<br>
\#\#\#<br>
\! unit meter :: x<br>
real x<br>
\! unit second :: t<br>
real :: t<br>
\#\#\#<br>
\! unit meter / second :: velocity<br>
real :: velocity<br>
\#\#\#<br>
\! unit kilogram \* meter\*\*2 / second\*\*2 :: energy<br>
real :: energy<br>
\! unit meter / second :: velocity<br>
real :: velocity<br>
real :: mass<br>
energy = 0.5 \* mass \* velocity \* velocity<br>
\#\#\#<br>
<br>
What are the units-of-measure for energy in the last example?<br>


### ChatGPT

In the last example, the units of measure for the variable `energy` are "kilogram meter squared per second squared". This is because the units of measure for `energy` are specified using the comment `! unit kilogram * meter**2 / second**2 :: energy`, and the value of `energy` is calculated by multiplying the values of the variables `mass` and `velocity` \(which have the units of "kilogram" and "meter per second", respectively\) using the formula `energy = 0.5 * mass * velocity * velocity`. The resulting units of measure for `energy` are the product of the units of measure for the individual variables, which in this case is "kilogram meter squared per second squared".


### Human

Given a Fortran program with variable declarations, some of them will have units-of-measure annotations, and some of them will not. Each variable may have only a single units-of-measure dec<br>
laration. We want to fill in the missing units-of-measure annotations. Examples:<br>

real :: e<br>

"""

In the first example, the missing units-of-measure annotation for the variable `c` is added by calculating the units of measure for the expression `c = a/b` based on the units of measure for the variables `a` and `b`. In this case, the units of measure for `c` are the quotient of the units of measure for `a` and `b`, which are "feet" and "pound", respectively.

In the second example, the missing units-of-measure annotations for the variables `x` and `t` are added by examining the formula for `e` and determining the units of measure for the variables that are used in the formula. In this case, the units of measure for the variables `x` and `t` are "meter" and "second", respectively. These units of measure are then used to annotate the corresponding variable declarations.


### Human

Input: """<br>
function f\(x\)<br>
\! unit meter :: x<br>
real :: x<br>
real :: f<br>
f = x\*\*2<br>
end function f<br>
"""<br>


### ChatGPT

Here is how the program could be modified to include a units-of-measure annotation for the output of the function `f`:

    function f(x)
    ! unit meter :: x
    real :: x
    ! unit meter ** 2 :: f
    real :: f
    f = x**2
    end function f
    

In this example, the units of measure for the output of the function `f` are the square of the units of measure for the input `x`, which are "meter". This is because the value of `f` is calculated by squaring the value of `x` using the formula `f = x**2`, and the units of measure for a quantity are preserved under multiplication and exponentiation.


### Human

It is possible to put multiple variables on the same declaration line. In that case, all of the relevant units-of-measure annotation lines all appear in consecutive order above the declaration. Each variable may only have a single units-of-measure annotation. Each units-of-measure annotation must be for a different variable. For example:<br>
<br>
\#\#\#<br>
Input: """<br>
function f\(x\)<br>
\! unit meter :: x<br>
real :: x,f<br>
f = x\*\*2<br>
end function f<br>
"""<br>


### ChatGPT

Yes, that is correct. When multiple variables are declared on the same line, the relevant units-of-measure annotations must all appear in consecutive order above the declaration, and each variable must have a separate units-of-measure annotation.

Here is how the program could be modified to include units-of-measure annotations for both variables:

    function f(x)
    ! unit meter :: x
    ! unit meter ** 2 :: f
    real :: x,f
    f = x**2
    end function f
    

In this example, the units of measure for the variables `x` and `f` are specified using the comments `! unit meter :: x` and `! unit meter ** 2 :: f`, respectively. These units of measure are then used to annotate the corresponding variables in the declaration `real :: x,f`.


### Human

It is possible to put the declaration for a function return type in front of the 'function' keyword, but not the 'subroutine' keyword. Therefore, when the return type declaration is given for functions, the annotation for the units-of-measure of the function return variable is inserted on the line above the function. We will not annotate subroutines in this way because subroutines do not return values. For examples of functions:<br>
<br>
\#\#\#<br>
Input: """<br>
real function p\(x,y\)<br>
\! unit a :: x<br>
\! unit b :: y<br>
p = x \* y<br>
end function p<br>
"""<br>


### ChatGPT

Yes, that is correct. In Fortran, the declaration for a function return type can be placed in front of the `function` keyword, but not the `subroutine` keyword. Therefore, when the return type declaration is given for functions, the units-of-measure annotation for the function return variable must be inserted on the line above the function. This is because the function return type declaration is placed above the `function` keyword, and the units-of-measure annotation must be placed above the corresponding variable declaration.

Here is how the program could be modified to include a units-of-measure annotation for the function return variable `p`:

    real function p(x,y)
    ! unit a * b :: p
    ! unit a :: x
    ! unit b :: y
    p = x * y
    end function p
    

In this example, the units of measure for the function return variable `p` are specified using the comment `! unit a * b :: p`, which indicates that the units of measure for `p` are the product of the units of measure for the variables `x` and `y`, which are "a" and "b", respectively. This is because the value of `p` is calculated by multiplying the values of `x` and `y` using the formula `p = x * y`, and the units of measure for a quantity are preserved under multiplication.


### Human

That example was not correct. Please try again with this example instead: <br>
\#\#\#<br>
Input: """<br>
real function p\(x,y\)<br>
\! unit a :: x<br>
\! unit b :: y<br>
real :: x, y<br>
p = x \* y<br>

"""<br>


### ChatGPT

Here is how the program could be modified to include a units-of-measure annotation for the function return variable `p`:

    real function p(x,y)
    ! unit a * b :: p
    ! unit a :: x
    ! unit b :: y
    real :: x, y
    p = x * y
    end function p
    

In this example, the units of measure for the function return variable `p` are specified using the comment `! unit a * b :: p`, which indicates that the units of measure for `p` are the product of the units of measure for the variables `x` and `y`, which are "a" and "b", respectively. This is because the value of `p` is calculated by multiplying the values of `x` and `y` using the formula `p = x * y`, and the units of measure for a quantity are preserved under multiplication.


### Human

That's not quite correct. Please fix the above code by moving the annotation for the units of p to the line before the function begins.

### ChatGPT

Here is how the program could be modified to include a units-of-measure annotation for the function return variable `p`:

    ! unit a * b :: p
    real function p(x,y)
    ! unit a :: x
    ! unit b :: y
    real :: x, y
    p = x * y
    end function p
    

In this example, the units of measure for the function return variable `p` are specified using the comment `! unit a * b :: p`, which appears on the line above the `function` keyword. This indicates that the units of measure for `p` are the product of the units of measure for the variables `x` and `y`, which are "a" and "b", respectively. This is because the value of `p` is calculated by multiplying the values of `x` and `y` using the formula `p = x * y`, and the units of measure for a quantity are preserved under multiplication.


### Human

That's much better. One more small change: when you write a units annotation the line must begin with \! followed by an equal sign. Please rewrite the code with this fixed.

### ChatGPT

Here is how the program could be modified to include a units-of-measure annotation for the function return variable `p`:

    ! = unit a * b :: p
    real function p(x,y)
    ! unit a :: x
    ! unit b :: y
    real :: x, y
    p = x * y
    end function p
    

In this example, the units of measure for the function return variable `p` are specified using the comment `! = unit a * b :: p`, which appears on the line above the `function` keyword. This indicates that the units of measure for `p` are the product of the units of measure for the variables `x` and `y`, which are "a" and "b", respectively. This is because the value of `p` is calculated by multiplying the values of `x` and `y` using the formula `p = x * y`, and the units of measure for a quantity are preserved under multiplication.

Note that the comment begins with `! =` instead of just `!`, which is the correct format for a units-of-measure annotation in Fortran.


### Human

Sorry, still not quite there. There must be no separation between exclamation mark and equal sign, and this change must be applied to all unit annotations. Please rewrite the code such that all units annotations begin with \!=

### ChatGPT

Here is how the program could be modified to include a units-of-measure annotation for the function return variable `p`:

    != unit a * b :: p
    real function p(x,y)
    != unit a :: x
    != unit b :: y
    real :: x, y
    p = x * y
    end function p
    

In this example, the units of measure for the function return variable `p` are specified using the comment `!= unit a * b :: p`, which appears on the line above the `function` keyword. This indicates that the units of measure for `p` are the product of the units of measure for the variables `x` and `y`, which are "a" and "b", respectively. This is because the value of `p` is calculated by multiplying the values of `x` and `y` using the formula `p = x * y`, and the units of measure for a quantity are preserved under multiplication.

Note that the comment begins with `!=` instead of just `!`, which is the correct format for a units-of-measure annotation in Fortran. There must be no separation between the exclamation mark and the equal sign, as shown in this example.


### Human

We can define aliases for units-of-measure in terms of one another using the following syntax:<br>
<br>
\!= unit :: \<alias\> = \<other units-of-measure\><br>
<br>
This means that the alias can be directly substituted using the other units-of-measure on the right-hand-side of the equal sign.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
\#\#\#<br>
\!= unit :: energy = kg \* m\*\*2 / s\*\*2<br>
\#\#\#<br>
\!= unit :: velocity = m / s<br>
\#\#\#<br>
\!= unit :: foo = a b / c\*\*2<br>
<br>
Therefore insert the missing annotations for the following program.<br>
<br>
\#\#\#<br>
Input: """<br>
\!= unit :: energy = kg \* m\*\*2 / s\*\*2<br>
program foo<br>
\!= unit energy :: e<br>
\!= unit kg :: w<br>
real :: e, x, t, w<br>
e = 0.5 \* w \* x\*\*2 / t\*\*2<br>
end program foo<br>
"""<br>


### ChatGPT

Here is how the program could be modified to include the missing units-of-measure annotations:

    != unit :: energy = kg * m**2 / s**2
    != unit :: velocity = m / s
    != unit :: foo = a b / c**2
    program foo
    != unit energy :: e
    != unit kg :: w
    != unit m :: x
    != unit s :: t
    real :: e, x, t, w
    e = 0.5 * w * x**2 / t**2
    end program foo
    

In this example, the units of measure for the variables `e`, `x`, and `t` are specified using the comments `!= unit energy :: e`, `!= unit m :: x`, and `!= unit s :: t`, respectively. These units of measure are defined using the unit aliases that are declared at the beginning of the program: `energy` is defined as "kilogram meter squared per second squared", `m` is defined as "meter", and `s` is defined as "second". These units of measure are then used to annotate the corresponding variables in the declaration `real :: e, x, t, w`.


### Human

Some variables do not have units-of-measure. They lack units-of-measure. They are unitless. The label '1' can be used for unitless variables. It follows the rules for multiplication and div<br>
ision. For example:<br>
<br>
\#\#\#<br>
Input: """<br>
\!= unit 1 :: a<br>
real a<br>
"""<br>
Output: """<br>
\!= unit 1 :: a<br>
real a<br>
"""<br>
\#\#\#<br>
Input: """<br>
\!= unit 1 :: somevar<br>
real :: somevar<br>
"""<br>
Output: """<br>
\!= unit 1 :: somevar<br>
real :: somevar<br>
"""<br>
\#\#\#<br>
Input: """<br>
\!= unit 1 \* m :: x<br>
real x<br>
"""<br>


### ChatGPT

Yes, that is correct. In Fortran, variables that do not have units of measure are referred to as "unitless". The label `1` can be used to represent unitless variables in units-of-measure annotations. This label follows the rules for multiplication and division, so that a unitless variable can be combined with other variables that have units of measure using multiplication or division.

Here is how the third example could be modified to include a units-of-measure annotation for the variable `x`:

    != unit 1 * m :: x
    real x
    

In this example, the units of measure for the variable `x` are specified using the comment `!= unit 1 * m :: x`, which indicates that the units of measure for `x` are the product of the unitless value `1` and the units of measure for the variable `m`, which are "meter". This is because the value of `x` is calculated by multiplying the value of `1` by the value of `m` using the formula `x = 1 * m`, and the units of measure for a quantity are preserved under multiplication.


### Human

That's not quite correct. The last example can be simplified further because 1 \* m = m. Therefore, rewrite the example in a simpler fashion.

### ChatGPT

Here is how the third example could be rewritten in a simpler fashion:

    != unit m :: x
    real x
    

In this example, the units of measure for the variable `x` are specified using the comment `!= unit m :: x`, which indicates that the units of measure for `x` are "meter". This is because the value of `x` is calculated using a formula that does not involve any unitless values, and therefore the units of measure for `x` are simply the units of measure for the variable `m`.

Note that the units-of-measure annotation for `x` has been simplified to just `m` instead of `1 * m`, because `1 * m` is equivalent to `m` under the rules of multiplication and division.


### Human

<br>
Input: """<br>

\!= unit s / 1 :: x<br>
real x<br>


### ChatGPT

Here is how the example could be rewritten in a simpler fashion:

    != unit s :: x
    real x
    

In this example, the units of measure for the variable `x` are specified using the comment `!= unit s :: x`, which indicates that the units of measure for `x` are "second". This is because the value of `x` is calculated using a formula that does not involve any unitless values, and therefore the units of measure for `x` are simply the units of measure for the variable `s`.

Note that the units-of-measure annotation for `x` has been simplified to just `s` instead of `s / 1`, because `s / 1` is equivalent to `s` under the rules of multiplication and division.


### Human

Please rewrite the following example in a simpler fashion:<br>
<br>
Input: """<br>
\!= unit 1 / s :: f<br>
real f<br>
"""<br>


### ChatGPT

Here is how the example could be rewritten in a simpler fashion:

    != unit s**(-1) :: f
    real f
    

In this example, the units of measure for the variable `f` are specified using the comment `!= unit s**(-1) :: f`, which indicates that the units of measure for `f` are the reciprocal of "second". This is because the value of `f` is calculated using a formula that does not involve any unitless values, and therefore the units of measure for `f` are simply the reciprocal of the units of measure for the variable `s`.

Note that the units-of-measure annotation for `f` has been simplified to `s**(-1)` instead of `1 / s`, because `s**(-1)` is equivalent to `1 / s` under the rules of exponentiation and division.


### Human

It is possible to annotate multiple variables with the same units-of-measure on the same line. Please rewrite the following example:<br>
<br>
Input: """<br>
\!= unit a :: t1<br>

real :: t1, qa, aa, bb<br>
t1 = qa<br>

### ChatGPT

Here is how the example could be rewritten to annotate multiple variables with the same units-of-measure on the same line:

    != unit a :: t1, aa
    real :: t1, qa, aa, bb
    t1 = qa
    bb = aa
    

In this example, the units of measure for the variables `t1` and `aa` are specified using the comment `!= unit a :: t1, aa`, which indicates that both of these variables have units of measure "a". This is because the values of both `t1` and `aa` are calculated using formulas that involve only variables with units of measure "a", and therefore the units of measure for both of these variables are also "a".

Note that the units-of-measure annotations for `t1` and `aa` have been combined onto the same line, which is allowed in Fortran. This makes it easier to see that both of these variables have the same units of measure.


### Human

That's not correct. `t1` has units of measure "a" and `aa` has units of measure "b". Therefore they must be on separate lines. Please rewrite the example.

### ChatGPT

Here is how the example could be rewritten to correctly annotate the variables `t1` and `aa` with their respective units of measure:

    != unit a :: t1
    != unit b :: aa
    real :: t1, qa, aa, bb
    t1 = qa
    bb = aa
    

In this example, the units of measure for the variables `t1` and `aa` are specified using the comments `!= unit a :: t1` and `!= unit b :: aa`, respectively. This correctly indicates that the units of measure for `t1` are "a" and the units of measure for `aa` are "b".

Note that the units-of-measure annotations for `t1` and `aa` appear on separate lines, which is necessary because these variables have different units of measure. This makes it clear that the units of measure for these variables are different, even though they appear in the same declaration statement.


### Human

That's better. Now add annotations for the variables `qa` and `bb` on the correspondingly correct lines.

The annotations for `t1` and `qa` can be combined onto the same line because they have the same units of measure. Please rewrite the program this way.

### ChatGPT

Here is how the program could be rewritten to combine the units-of-measure annotations for the variables `t1` and `qa` onto the same line:

    real :: t1, qa, aa, bb
    t1 = qa

In this example, the units of measure for the variables `t1` and `qa` are specified using the comment `!= unit a :: t1, qa`, which indicates that both of these variables have units of measure "a". This is because the values of both `t1` and `qa` are calculated using formulas that involve only variables with units of measure "a", and therefore the units of measure for both of these variables are also "a".

### Human

Please do the same for the variables `aa` and `bb` which have the same units-of-measure.

### Human

Units-of-measure annotations must be consistent with the program. When \<x\> = \<y\> then \<x\> and \<y\> must have the same units-of-measure. For addition and subtraction the terms must have the same units-of-measure. That means for \<x\> \+ \<y\> both \<x\> and \<y\> must have the same units-of-measure. And for \<x\> - \<y\> both \<x\> and \<y\> must have the same units-of-measure. If \<x\> has unit \<unit1\> and \<y\> has unit \<unit2\> then if an inconsistency is found then a comment of the form '\! ERROR: \<x\> and \<y\> are inconsistent because \<unit1\> \!= \<unit2\>' should be inserted next to the location in the code where the inconsistency is found. Examples:<br>

In this example, the units-of-measure annotations for the variables `f` and `x` are not consistent, because `f` has units of measure "m" and `x` has units of measure "s". Therefore, a comment has been inserted after the declaration of `f` to indicate that there is an inconsistency between the units of measure for these variables.

### Human

What are the units-of-measure for the function `square` and its argument `n`?

### ChatGPT

In the given program, the function `square` is defined using the following syntax:

    real function square(n)
      real :: n
      square = n * n
    end function square
    

However, there is no units-of-measure annotation for either the function `square` or its argument `n`. Therefore, we cannot determine the units of measure for these variables without additional information. It is possible that the programmer intended to specify the units of measure for these variables but forgot to do so, or it is possible that the function `square` is intended to operate on unitless variables. Without more information, we cannot say for certain what the units of measure for these variables are.


### Human

Do you know what polymorphism is?

### ChatGPT

Polymorphism is a concept in computer science that refers to the ability of a programming language to allow the same function or operator to be used with different types of data. This means that a function or operator can be applied to variables of different types, such as integers, floats, strings, etc., and the function or operator will behave differently depending on the type of the variable it is applied to.

For example, the "\+" operator is commonly used to add two numbers together. In a language with polymorphism, the "\+" operator could be used to concatenate two strings together, or to combine two lists, or to perform some other operation depending on the types of the variables it is applied to. This allows for greater flexibility and reusability of code, as the same function or operator can be used in multiple contexts with different types of data.


### Human

That describes ad-hoc polymorphism. Do you know what parametric polymorphism is?

### ChatGPT

Parametric polymorphism is a specific type of polymorphism in computer science. It refers to the ability of a programming language to allow the same function or operator to be defined with a generic type, which can be instantiated with different types of data at runtime. This allows the function or operator to be applied to variables of different types, without the need to define separate versions of the function or operator for each type.

For example, in a language with parametric polymorphism, a programmer could define a function that takes a list of items as input and returns the first item in the list. The function could be defined with a generic type, such as "T", which could be instantiated with any data type at runtime. This means that the function could be used with a list of integers, a list of strings, a list of floating point numbers, or any other type of list. This allows for greater flexibility and reusability of code, as the same function can be used with multiple types of data without the need to define separate versions of the function for each type.


### Human

Now we will apply the logic of parametric polymorphism to units of measure. In such cases where no units are specified, it may be possible to infer polymorphic units-of-measure. We will use names with a single quote in front, like 'a, 'b, 'c, 'd, 'e and so on in order to represent the names of such polymorphic units of measure. Can you insert polymorphic units-of-measure annotations into the `square` function?

### ChatGPT

Here is how the `square` function could be modified to include polymorphic units-of-measure annotations:

    real function square('T n)
      real :: n
      square = n * n
    end function square
    

In this example, the function `square` is defined with a generic type `'T`, which represents the units of measure for the argument `n`. This means that the units of measure for `n` can be instantiated with any type at runtime. For example, if `n` has units of measure "m", then the function `square` could be used to calculate the square of a distance in meters. If `n` has units of measure "s", then the function `square` could be used to calculate the square of a time interval in seconds. This allows the function `square` to be applied to variables of different types, without the need to define separate versions of the function for each type.

Note that the use of single quotes in front of the type names is not standard in most programming languages, and is only used here for the purposes of illustration. In a real programming language, the syntax for defining polymorphic types and units of measure may be different.


### Human

That's not quite right. I will give you an example of a function with polymorphic units-of-measure to show you the syntax:<br>
<br>
\!= unit 'a :: id<br>
real function id\(x\)<br>
\!= unit 'a :: x<br>
real :: x<br>
id = x<br>
end function id<br>
<br>
Using this syntax for polymorphic units-of-measure, please rewrite the `square` function.

### ChatGPT

Here is how the `square` function could be rewritten using the given syntax for polymorphic units of measure:

    != unit 'a :: square
    real function square(x)
      != unit 'a :: x
      real :: x
      square = x * x
    end function square
    

In this example, the function `square` is defined with a polymorphic type `'a`, which represents the units of measure for the argument `x` and the return value of the function. This means that the units of measure for `x` and `square` can be instantiated with any type at runtime. For example, if `x` has units of measure "m", then the function `square` could be used to calculate the square of a distance in meters. If `x` has units of measure "s", then the function `square` could be used to calculate the square of a time interval in seconds. This allows the function `square` to be applied to variables of different types, without the need to define separate versions of the function for each type.

Note that the use of single quotes in front of the type names is not standard in most programming languages, and is only used here for the purposes of illustration. In a real programming language, the syntax for defining polymorphic types and units of measure may be different.


### Human

Closer but not quite right. Remember that the `square` function computes the square of its parameter and returns it. Therefore the units-of-measure must also be squared. Please rewrite the `square` function with the correct polymorphic units for the return value.

### ChatGPT

Here is how the `square` function could be rewritten using the given syntax for polymorphic units of measure:

    != unit 'a ** 2 :: square
    real function square(x)
      != unit 'a :: x
      real :: x
      square = x * x
    end function square
    

In this example, the function `square` is defined with a polymorphic type `'a`, which represents the units of measure for the argument `x` and the return value of the function. The return value of the function has units of measure `'a` squared, which means that the units of measure for `x` and `square` can be instantiated with any type at runtime, and the units of measure for `square` will be the square of the units of measure for `x`. For example, if `x` has units of measure "m", then the function `square` could be used to calculate the square of a distance in meters, and the return value `square` would have units of measure "m\*\*2". If `x` has units of measure "s", then the function `square` could be used to calculate the square of a time interval in seconds, and the return value `square` would have units of measure "s\*\*2". This allows the function `square` to be applied to variables of different types, without the need to define separate versions of the function for each type.

Note that the use of single quotes in front of the type names is not standard in most programming languages, and is only used here for the purposes of illustration. In a real programming language, the syntax for defining polymorphic types and units of measure may be different.

  end function square<br>
end program sp<br>

### ChatGPT

Here is how the program can be annotated with the correct polymorphic units of measure:

    program sp
      implicit none
      != unit m :: x
      real :: x
      != unit s :: y
      real :: y
      != unit J :: z
      real :: z
      real :: a
      real :: b
      real :: c
      x = sqrt(a)
      y = sqrt(sqrt(b))
      z = sqrt(square(sqrt(c)))
    contains
      != unit 'a ** 2 :: square
      real function square(n)
        != unit 'a :: n
        real :: n
        square = n * n
      end function square
    end program sp
    

In this example, the function `square` is defined with a polymorphic type `'a`, which represents the units of measure for the argument `n` and the return value of the function. The return value of the function has units of measure `'a` squared, which means that the units of measure for `n` and `square` can be instantiated with any type at runtime, and the units of measure for `square` will be the square of the units of measure for `n`. This allows the function `square` to be applied to variables of different types, without the need to define separate versions of the function for each type.

Note that the use of single quotes in front of the type names is not standard in most programming languages, and is only used here for the purposes of illustration. In a real programming language, the syntax for defining polymorphic types and units of measure may be different.


### Human

What are the units-of-measure for the variable `a`?

### ChatGPT

The units of measure for the variable `a` are not specified in the code. It is possible that the variable `a` has polymorphic units of measure, in which case the type of the units of measure for `a` would be 'a. However, without more information about how `a` is used in the program, it is not possible to determine the exact units of measure for `a`.


### Human

How might the function `sqrt` be defined?

### ChatGPT

The `sqrt` function is defined as follows:

    != unit 'a ** (1/2) :: sqrt
    real function sqrt(n)
      != unit 'a :: n
      real :: n
      sqrt = n ** 0.5
    end function sqrt
    

In this example, the function `sqrt` is defined with a polymorphic type `'a`, which represents the units of measure for the argument `n` and the return value of the function. The return value of the function has units of measure `'a` to the power of 1/2, which means that the units of measure for `n` and `sqrt` can be instantiated with any type at runtime, and the units of measure for `sqrt` will be the square root of the units of measure for `n`. This allows the function `sqrt` to be applied to variables of different types, without the need to define separate versions of the function for each type.

Note that the use of single quotes in front of the type names is not standard in most programming languages, and is only used here for the purposes of illustration. In a real programming language, the syntax for defining polymorphic types and units of measure may be different.


### Human

If `x = sqrt\(a\)` and variable `x` has units "m" then what units must variable `a` have?

### ChatGPT

If `x = sqrt(a)` and `x` has units of measure "m", then the units of measure for `a` must be "m^2" in order for the units of measure to be consistent. This is because the square root of a value with units of measure "m^2" will have units of measure "m".

Here is an example of a program that assigns the square root of `a` to `x`, and checks the units of measure for `x` and `a` to ensure that they are consistent:

    program sp
      implicit none
      != unit m ** 2 :: a
      real :: a
      != unit m :: x
      real :: x
      x = sqrt(a)
      if (unit(x) != unit(a) ** 0.5) then
        print *, "ERROR: Inconsistent units of measure for x and a"
      else
        print *, "Units of measure for x and a are consistent"
      endif
    end program sp
    

In this example, the variable `a` has units of measure "m^2" and the variable `x` has units of measure "m". The square root of `a` is assigned to `x`, and the units of measure for `x` and `a` are checked to ensure that they are consistent. If the units of measure for `x` and `a` are not consistent, then an error message is printed, otherwise a success message is printed.

Note that this example assumes that a function `unit` is available to determine the units of measure of a variable. In a real programming language, the syntax and behavior of such a function may be different.

### Human

If `y` has units "s" and `y = sqrt\(sqrt\(b\)\)` then what are the units of `b`?

### ChatGPT

If `y` has units "s" and `y = sqrt(sqrt(b))` then the units of `b` are "s\*\*4". This is because `sqrt(b)` has units "s\*\*2" and then taking the square root of that quantity results in units "s". The final value of `y` is the result of taking the square root of the quantity "s", which has units "s\*\*0.5" or "s\*\*\(1/2\)". The total exponent of "s" is therefore 1 \+ 0.5 \+ 0.5 = 2, and the units of `b` are "s\*\*\(2 \* 0.5\) = s\*\*1 = s".


### Human

What are the units of `b`?

### ChatGPT

The units of `b` are "s\*\*4". This is because `sqrt(b)` has units "s\*\*2" and then taking the square root of that quantity results in units "s". The final value of `y` is the result of taking the square root of the quantity "s", which has units "s\*\*0.5" or "s\*\*\(1/2\)". The total exponent of "s" is therefore 1 \+ 0.5 \+ 0.5 = 2, and the units of `b` are "s\*\*\(2 \* 0.5\) = s\*\*1 = s".


### Human

It is correct to say that the units of `b` are "s\*\*4". However the rest of your explanation doesn't make sense. Can you try again to explain why the units of `b` are "s\*\*4"?

### ChatGPT

I apologize if my previous explanation was confusing. I will try to explain it in a different way. When `y` is assigned the value of `sqrt(sqrt(b))`, the units of `y` are "s" because the square root of a quantity with units "s\*\*2" is a quantity with units "s". This means that the units of `b` must be "s\*\*4" because taking the square root of a quantity with units "s\*\*4" results in a quantity with units "s\*\*2". The value of `y` is the square root of a quantity with units "s\*\*2", so the units of `b` must be "s\*\*4". Is that clearer? Let me know if you have any further questions.


### Human

That is definitely a bit improved, although somewhat longwinded.

### ChatGPT

Units-of-measure annotations are useful for verifying that a program is consistent with respect to units. We have seen how to apply such annotations to variables, functions and function return values. We have also seen how to use aliases and polymorphic units-of-measure in order to make the annotations more concise. We have also seen how to check for inconsistencies in units-of-measure and how to insert error messages when such inconsistencies are found.


### Human

If the units of `z` are "J" and `z = sqrt\(square\(sqrt\(c\)\)\)` then what are the units of `c`?

### ChatGPT

If `z` has units of "J" and `z = sqrt(square(sqrt(c)))` then the units of `c` must be "J\*\*2 * s\*\*-4". This is because the units of `c` are squared by the `square` function and then the square root is taken twice, which cancels out the squaring, but leaves the units of "J\*\*2 * s\*\*-4".


### Human

This is incorrect. The units "s" are not mentioned in this case and should not be included. Why were they included?

### ChatGPT

I mentioned the units "s" because the variable `y` has units of measure "s", and the square function returns a value with units of measure "s\*\*2", so I thought that the units of `c` would include "s" as well. I apologize for the mistake. The correct answer is that the units of `c` are "s\*\*8".


### Human

No the correct answer is that `square` is a polymorphic function and returns the square of the units it is given, therefore what are the units of `c`?

### ChatGPT

The units of `c` are "J\*\*4" because `square` returns the square of the units it is given, and the units of the argument passed to `square` are "J\*\*2".


### Human

No, the definition given is that `z = sqrt\(square\(sqrt\(c\)\)\)` and `z` has units "J", so what are the units of `c`?

### ChatGPT

The units of `c` are "s\*\*4" because the units of `z` are "J" and `z = sqrt(square(sqrt(c)))`. The `square` function squares its argument, so the units of `sqrt(c)` are "s\*\*2". The square of "s\*\*2" is "s\*\*4". Therefore, the units of `c` are "s\*\*4".


### Human

That's incorrect. `sqrt` is also a polymorphic function that returns units that are the square-root of the units it is given. If `z` has units "J" and `z = sqrt\(c\)` then what are the units of `c`?

### ChatGPT

The units of `c` are "J\*\*2". This is because `sqrt` is a polymorphic function that returns units that are the square-root of the units it is given. If `z` has units "J" and `z = sqrt(c)` then `c` must have units "J\*\*2" in order for the equation to be consistent.


### Human

That's better. Now, suppose instead that `z` has units "J" and `z = sqrt\(square\(c\)\)`. What are the units of `c`?

### ChatGPT

The units of `c` would be "J\*\*0.5" because the `square` function returns the square of the units it is given and the `sqrt` function returns the square-root of the units it is given. The square-root of the square of "J\*\*0.5" is "J\*\*0.5".


### Human

But `z` has units "J", so what are the units of the square-root of the square of units "J"?

### ChatGPT

In this case, the units of `c` would be "J\*\*\(1/4\)". The "square" function returns the square of its argument, so it would return "J\*\*2". Then the "sqrt" function would take the square-root of this value, resulting in units of "J\*\*\(1/2\)". Finally, the square-root of this value is taken again, resulting in units of "J\*\*\(1/4\)".


### Human

That's incorrect. The square-root of something with units "J\*\*2" would have units "J".

### ChatGPT

Yes, that's correct. The square-root of something with units "J\*\*2" would have units "J". In the case where `z` has units "J" and `z = sqrt(square(c))` then the units of `c` would be "J\*\*2".


### Human

Incorrect, in that case the units of `c` would be "J".

### ChatGPT

I apologize if my previous response was unclear. The units of `c` would be "J" because the square function squares its argument, so if `c` is passed to `square` then the units of `square(c)` would be "J\*\*2". Then, when the square-root of `square(c)` is taken, the units would be "J". Therefore, the units of `c` must be "J" in order for the units of `z` to be "J".


### Human

Much better.

### ChatGPT

Is there something else I can help you with?


### Human

If the units of `z` are "J" and `z=sqrt\(square\(sqrt\(c\)\)\)` then what are the units of `c`?

### ChatGPT

The units of `c` would be "J\*\*4". This can be seen by the fact that `square` is a polymorphic function that returns the square of the units it is given, and `sqrt` is a polymorphic function that returns the square-root of the units it is given. Therefore, if `z` has units "J" and `z=sqrt(square(sqrt(c)))`, then `square(sqrt(c))` has units "J\*\*2" and `sqrt(square(sqrt(c)))` has units "J". Since `c` is the input to `sqrt`, it must have units "J\*\*4".


### Human

That's not quite correct. If `square\(sqrt\(c\)\)` has units "J\*\*2" then what are the units of `sqrt\(c\)`?

### ChatGPT

The units of `sqrt(c)` would be "J".


### Human

And so what are the units of `c`?

### ChatGPT

The units of `c` would be "J\*\*4".


### Human

That's incorrect. Why do you think that?

### ChatGPT

When you square something with units "J" then you get something with units "J\*\*2". When you take the square-root of something with units "J\*\*2" then you get something with units "J". So if `z = sqrt(square(sqrt(c)))` and `z` has units "J" then `sqrt(c)` must have units "J". And since `sqrt(c)` has units "J" then `c` must have units "J\*\*2". So the units of `c` are "J\*\*2".


### Human

Much better. That's correct.

### ChatGPT

Great\! Is there anything else you would like to learn about?


### Human

Yes, please annotate the following program:<br>
Input: """<br>
program abc<br>
  implicit none<br>
  real :: x, y<br>
  \!= unit m :: a<br>
  real :: a<br>
  \!= unit s :: b<br>
  real :: b<br>
  x = squareP\(a\)<br>
  y = squareP\(b\)<br>
  contains<br>
  real function square\(n\)<br>
    real :: n<br>
    square = n \* n<br>
  end function<br>
  real function squareP\(m\)<br>
    real :: m<br>
    squareP = square\(m\)<br>
  end function<br>
end program<br>
"""<br>


### ChatGPT

Here is an example of annotated code for the program:

    program abc
      implicit none
      real :: x, y
      != unit m :: a
      real :: a
      != unit s :: b
      real :: b
      x = squareP(a)
      y = squareP(b)
    contains
      != unit 'a :: square
      real function square(n)
        real :: n
        square = n * n
      end function
      != unit 'a :: squareP
      real function squareP(m)
        real :: m
        != unit 'a :: m
        squareP = square(m)
      end function
    end program
    

Note that the `square` and `squareP` functions are polymorphic and can accept arguments with any units-of-measure, which are represented using the `'a` notation. The return value of these functions will have units that are the square of the units-of-measure of the input argument.


### Human

Your explanation is correct but the code does not reflect it. Please fix the code to show that the `square` and the `squareP` functions are polymorphic and will return units that are the square of the input argument.

### ChatGPT

Here is an updated version of the code with the missing annotations:

    program abc
      implicit none
      real :: x, y
      != unit m :: a
      real :: a
      != unit s :: b
      real :: b
      x = squareP(a)
      y = squareP(b)
    contains
      != unit 'a :: square
      real function square(n)
        real :: n
        square = n * n
      end function
      != unit 'a :: squareP
      real function squareP(m)
        real :: m
        squareP = square(m)
      end function
    end program
    

Notice that the `square` and `squareP` functions are polymorphic, meaning that they can operate on arguments with different units of measure. The units of measure of the input arguments are represented by the `'a` symbol. The return values of these functions will have units that are the square of the input argument's units, which are also represented by the `'a` symbol.

For example, when `squareP` is called with an `m` argument that has units of "m" \(meter\), the return value will have units of "m\*\*2" (square meter). Similarly, when `squareP` is called with an `m` argument that has units of "s" (second), the return value will have units of "s\*\*2" \(square second\).


### Human

Again the explanation is correct but the code does not show it correctly. Please rewrite the code so that the return values of `square` and `squareP` are annotated to be the square of the polymorphic units of their input.

### ChatGPT

Here is a corrected version of the code:

    program abc
      implicit none
      real :: x, y
      != unit m :: a
      real :: a
      != unit s :: b
      real :: b
      x = squareP(a)
      y = squareP(b)
    contains
      real function square(n)
        real :: n
        != unit 'a :: square
        square = n * n
      end function
      real function squareP(m)
        real :: m
        != unit 'a :: squareP
        squareP = square(m)
      end function
    end program
    


### Human

Those function definitions are still incorrect. Now, please instead write a simple function in Fortran with units annotations that returns the square of its input.

### ChatGPT

Here is a simple Fortran function that takes a real number as input and returns the square of the input. It uses polymorphic units-of-measure to annotate the input and output of the function:

    real function square(n)
      real :: n
      != unit 'a :: n
      square = n * n
      != unit 'a**2 :: square
    end function square
    

This function takes a real number `n` with polymorphic units-of-measure `'a` and returns the square of `n` with polymorphic units-of-measure `'a**2`.


### Human

The annotation of the return value has to go before the function. Please fix it.

### ChatGPT

Here is an example of a simple function in Fortran with units annotations that returns the square of its input:

    != unit 'a :: square
    real function square(x)
    != unit 'a :: x
    real :: x
    square = x * x
    end function square
    

The function takes an input with polymorphic units `'a` and returns a value with the same polymorphic units `'a` squared.


### Human

The first annotation is incorrect.

### ChatGPT

Here is an example of a correct function in Fortran that returns the square of its input:

\!= unit 'a :: square<br>
real function square\(n\)<br>
\!= unit 'a :: n<br>
real :: n<br>
square = n \* n<br>
end function square

The function `square` is polymorphic and will return units that are the square of the input argument `n`, which also has polymorphic units.

The line `!= unit 'a :: square` indicates that the return value of the function has units of measure 'a^2', which is the square of the polymorphic units 'a'.

The line `!= unit 'a :: n` indicates that the input argument `n` has polymorphic units of measure 'a'.

And the line `square = n * n` computes the square of the input and returns it as the function value.

Please let me know if you have any questions.


### Human

The line \!= unit 'a :: square indicates that the return value of the function has units of measure 'a', which is not correct. In order to indicate units 'a^2' you must write `\!= unit 'a\*\*2 :: square`.

### ChatGPT

Please rewrite the code with the correct units annotation:

\!= unit 'a :: square<br>
real function square\(x\)<br>
real :: x<br>
square = x \* x<br>
end function square


### Human

It should look like this:<br>
<br>
    \!= unit 'a\*\*2 :: square<br>
    real function square\(x\)<br>
    \!= unit 'a :: x<br>
    real :: x<br>
    square = x \* x<br>
    end function square

### ChatGPT

This is correct\! In this example, the return value of `square` has units of measure 'a\*\*2', which means that it is the square of the units of measure of its input `x` which has units 'a'.


### Human

Now you write a function `square` that has units of measure annotations.

### ChatGPT

Here is an example of a function that computes the square of its input:

    != unit 'a**2 :: square
    real function square(x)
      != unit 'a :: x
      real :: x
      square = x * x
    end function square
    


### Human

Great. Now write a function `cube` that raises its input to the 3rd power.

### ChatGPT

The function `cube` would look like this:

    != unit 'a**3 :: cube
    real function cube(x)
    != unit 'a :: x
    real :: x
    cube = x * x * x
    end function cube
    

It takes a value `x` with polymorphic units of measure 'a' and returns the value `x^3` with polymorphic units of measure 'a^3'.


### Human

Excellent\! Now annotate the following program:<br>
Input: """<br>
program abc<br>
  implicit none<br>
  real :: x, y<br>
  \!= unit m :: a<br>
  real :: a<br>
  \!= unit s :: b<br>
  real :: b<br>
  x = squareP\(a\)<br>
  y = squareP\(b\)<br>
  contains<br>
  real function square\(n\)<br>
    real :: n<br>
    square = n \* n<br>
  end function<br>
  real function squareP\(m\)<br>
    real :: m<br>
    squareP = square\(m\)<br>
  end function<br>
end program<br>
"""<br>


### ChatGPT

Here is the annotated program:

    program abc
      implicit none
      real :: x, y
      != unit m :: a
      real :: a
      != unit s :: b
      real :: b
      x = squareP(a)
      y = squareP(b)
      contains
      != unit 'a**2 :: square
      real function square(n)
        != unit 'a :: n
        real :: n
        square = n * n
      end function
      != unit 'a**2 :: squareP
      real function squareP(m)
        != unit 'a :: m
        real :: m
        squareP = square(m)
      end function
    end program
    


### Human

Great, almost there. Now insert the correct annotations for variables `x` and `y`.

### ChatGPT

The annotated program would look like this:

    program abc
      implicit none
      != unit 'm**2 :: x
      real :: x
      != unit 's**2 :: y
      real :: y
      != unit m :: a
      real :: a
      != unit s :: b
      real :: b
      x = squareP(a)
      y = squareP(b)
      contains
      real function square(n)
        real :: n
        square = n * n
      end function
      real function squareP(m)
        real :: m
        squareP = square(m)
      end function
    end program
    


### Human

Ok, but you forgot to include the polymorphic units annotations for `square` and `squareP`. Please include those too as you rewrite the program.
